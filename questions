Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager

1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Semantic HTML is using the proper HTML tags for the sections being built in a web page as opposed to using <div> sections on everything. 
An example would be using the <H1> only once 
as a describing item on the site, using sections, headers, nav, footers, asides, etc. This also has a major effect for SEO purposes.

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
Block elements take up the full width of the entire page! The block elements will respect height and width commands, however inline commands do not 
respect height. Inline commands do not take up full width either, but they do let other elements flow around if needed much like a span or anchor tag.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
Content, padding, border, and margin.

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?
Align items center while using flexbox will always be on the cross-axis.


5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.
Git would be valuable to a team of developers because it allows you to revert the code back to its previous state, 
it will also allow you to compare
code changes over a specific area of time, it can also let you know who introduced a specific issue and when, as well as 
branching to work on specific areas with each developer.

You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. Skipping this section *will* prevent you from passing this challenge.
